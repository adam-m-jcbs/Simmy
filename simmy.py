# This is intended to be a generalized python infrastructure for managing a
# suite or grid of simulations.  The design to to have high-level abstract
# classes that take care of basics and that template the management, while
# implementations of the abstract classes will handle specific machines, codes,
# etc.  This is based in part on the infrastructure I developed for managing a
# suite of 3D Maestro models that ran on multiple supercomputers as well as
# debug runs on local workstations or laptops.  Those models are described in

#Notes on conventions, programming style:
#  1) All classes are in CamelCase with the first letter capitalized.  Class methods
#     are also in CamelCase with the first letter lower-case, e.g. myMethod().
#  2) Non-class functions and all variables are lowercase with underscores (_) 
#     acting as delimiters when needed/wanted.
#  3) An underscore prefix, e.g. _variable, means the named item is intended to be
#     private (Python doesn't provide for easily enforcing data hiding, it's all by 
#     convention).
#  4) Names that are in ALL_CAPS are intended as constants.

# Usage: load as a module
# Requirements
#    + Python 3
#    + Common scientific python tools: NumPy, matplotlib
#    TODO: fill in other requirements

#Global TODO
#   + As currently designed, simmy imposes a directory structure convention.
#   This can be a bit dangerous as I rely on this assumption quite a bit (e.g. I
#   will infer simulation labels from directory labels).  A user manually
#   changing a directory name can break pretty much everything.  Is it worth it
#   to redesign?  I personally like systematically enforcing a directory
#   structure/organization, but I predict this to be a point of fragility for
#   users that aren't me.

           Why a staging directory and a scratch directory?
           On many machines there is a large filesystem (scratch) for running
           simulations that is purged and a smaller filesystem (stage) that is
           backed up.  This is the motivation for having a staging and scratch
           directory.
           
           The setup for simulations and their reduced (small size) output will
           be kept in staging, while the actual run and large output will be
           executed in scratch.  Large output that can't fit in staging should be
           stored in high performance storage that is available on most machines
           that have the stage/scratch configuration.  Even for systems that
           don't have a purged scratch directory, this is a nice way to keep a
           clean space with simulation essentials and a place to tweak and
           experiment on a run.
